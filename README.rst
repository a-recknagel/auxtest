Development Quickstart
----------------------
This project uses poetry_ for dependency management, so please make sure
`it is installed`_ on your work station. If it is, you should first run
``poetry install`` in the project root, and after entering your fresh new
virtual environment with ``poetry shell`` you are ready to go.


Project Description
-------------------

This is a project I only set up to test the github actions, and if I can
get my gitlab CI setup to work here as well.
