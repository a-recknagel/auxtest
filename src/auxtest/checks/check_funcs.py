"""Collection of check functions that can be called in the check-route.

Right now their names are equal to the names of their return keys, so we might
chose to streamline some of the logic to make this very configurable. It would
nail this app to only support keyword arguments that conform to python's
function naming rules, so it might be a bad call to nail this down just yet.

Notes:
    * Might extend the call api with the 'country' kwarg to disambiguate in case
    there are many cities with the submitted name.
